## About The Project

This project was conceived and developed as part of the "Typescript,
            React, and Web3" course in the Master’s program in Blockchain
            Development at start2impact University. The initial goal was to
            create a <strong>decentralized application</strong> that would
            enable users to purchase products using 
            <strong>blockchain payments</strong>.

<br>

From there, I expanded the project to imagine a platform that allows
            everyone to 
            <strong>freely access high-quality scientific articles</strong> 
            through the blockchain. Today, research materials are often locked
            behind paywalls or restricted to university staff, making them hard
            for the general public to access.

<br>

Academify aims to change this by making all articles available to
            the public while ensuring the 
            <strong>reliability of the information</strong>.

<br>

In the first phase of development, I focused on building the 
            <strong>core features</strong>: saving and displaying articles,
            connecting to the blockchain, and enabling payment and access to the
            final content.
            
<br>

I used <strong>key blockchain technologies</strong> like IPFS for
            storage, wallet connectors, and test network transactions with
            SepoliaETH tokens.

<br>

What you see now is just a basic MVP of the platform, showcasing its
            potential direction.
            
<br>

The goal is to make the platform even more inclusive by 
            <strong>introducing roles</strong> that contribute to the
            ecosystem's integrity. For instance, the role of certifier will be
            crucial. Certifiers are selected users who review articles submitted
            by the community and decide whether they should be published on the
            platform.
            
<br>

To reward certifiers for their work, I plan to introduce 
            <strong>a token called $OWL</strong> (inspired by the Academify
            logo). Certifiers can earn these tokens through their activities,
            and users who purchase articles will also earn them as a form of
            engagement score.
            
<br>

What you see now is just a basic MVP of the platform, showcasing its
            potential direction.
